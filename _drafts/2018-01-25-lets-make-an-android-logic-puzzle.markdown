  1. Name your app.
  2. Your personal/business domain (can be anything, but should be unique so that the app's name doesn't conflict with an app with the same name in places like the Play store).
  3. Where are you storing your project? I recommend creating a folder for Android projects.
  4. Click Next.
- Unless you have a specific use case, just use the default settings for Target Android Devices. Click Next.

- We just need an empty activity for now, so click Next.

- I'll use the defaults for now. As apps get more complicated we start thinking of better names to organize everything. For now, keep the defaults and click Finish.
