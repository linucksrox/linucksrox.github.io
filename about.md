I love learning. Although a majority of my work involves system administration tasks, I love finding ways to automate things with software and researching new technologies.

Currently I'm focused on learning Android development in my free time. I have some background in C++ and Java, so Android is a natural progression of those skills. I'll be interested in getting into Kotlin once I feel a little more comfortable with the basics of Android.

I run two servers at home, FreeNAS for storing files over my network, and ESXi running about 10 VMs for various services.
- pfSense firewall
- bind DNS
- Nextcloud using FreeNAS as the backend storage, supporting 6 users
- Ampache music streaming server (using dsub on Android for a Pandora like experience with my personal music collection)
- a random Linux distro using the lightweight LXDE which primarily runs Crashplan for backing up most data on my FreeNAS
- Nginx reverse proxy - this sits in front of Nextcloud and Ampache
- OpenVPN for external access into my network and security on public Wi-Fi networks
